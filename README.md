# ELEGANT SCIPY

## Objective

This project is intended to save my progress while studying the SciPy toolkit.

My reference in this project is "Elegant SciPy: The Art of Scientific Python", written by Juan Nunez-Iglesias, St√©fan van der Walt & Harriet Dashnow, published by O'Reilly.

As I progress in the book, I will create Jupyter Notebooks for my annotations, examples and exercise answers.

This project is developed in Microsoft Azure Notebooks and saved in GitHub repository. Azure Notebooks is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook service.

Created this repository and configured git repository before starting. I tried to set a SSH key to Azure Notebook to login into GitHub, but it is not possible. When the project stops running, the SSH key files are deleted from the project and a new one should be generated.

The best way to connect to GitHub through terminal command line when you have a 2 factor authentications is to [created an oauth token](https://help.github.com/pt/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
